- **Confidentiality:** Only those who are explicitly permitted to access a resource can access it.
- **Integrity:** Information and functionality stored is only which the owner intends to store (not modified unauthorized). Concerned with reliability and accuracy of data
- **Availability:** People who are supposed to access a resource can access it. An example is DoS attacks.

# Balance Triad with Organizational Objectives

Security controls can become a detriment to availability. If security is too strong, it may too frequently frustrate users, to the point that it leads users to frustration -> inefficiency and low moral!

We must make the users part of the continuous process of evaluation, exploration, threat modeling, discussion, testing, and release of security controls -> **Security is everyone's responsibility**
