# Security Principles

- **Principles of Least Privilege:** Each part within a system should only be granted the lowest possible privilege to achieve its task. 
	Narrows attack surface. Applies to all entities (human and non-human)

- **Defense in Depth:** Aka swiss cheese model which aims to add many layers of defense to a system, such that if one is bypassed, attacker is stopped by other layers.
	**No full infiltration**. Leaning on too many providers/tools to strengthen a specific weakness leads to single point failure.

- **Zero-Trust**: Advocates for removing all implicit trust in networks to protect access to all resource by making use of Principle of Least Privilege.
	Often implemented with granular authorization processes for every resource request. 
	
	Encapsulates 5 key elements:
	1.  Just-in-time Access (JITA) - access validated just before granted
	2. Just Enough Access (JEA)  
	3. Tokenization (replacing sensitive data with meaningless tokens) and Encryption
	4. Dynamic Access Control Policies - ensures policy is fit for purpose
	5. Micro-segmentation - limits access to appropriate level of granularity

- **Open Security:** Security of a system should not depend on its secrecy (Kerckhoff's?)

# Security Strategies

1. 24/7 vigilance
2. Threat modeling
3. Tabletop discussions
4. Continuous training on tactics, processes, and procedures
5. Continuous automated patching
6. Continuous supply chain verification
7. Secure coding and design
8. Daily log reviews
9. Multiple layers of well-implementedÂ [_Security Controls_](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_control)

*Controls* may be time consuming to use and maintain and may affect availability (e.g. if no fallback authorization) and profitability (if expensive).

# Security Models

Schema used to implement security controls in info systems. Don't specify controls but are theoretical frameworks. Can be implemented in different contexts.

* **Bell-LaPadula Model**: Used to enforce access control in system with multiple security levels. Focuses on confidentiality
