- **GLBA**: The [_Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act_](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/affordable-mortgage-lending-center/glba.html) (GLBA), enacted by the United States Congress in 1999, establishes several requirements that financial institutions must follow to protect consumers' financial information.
	Needs institutions to describe how they use and share info and allow individuals to opt out in certain cases. Enforces that financial info's confidentiality and integrity are actively protected.

- **GDPR**: The [_General Data Protection Regulation_](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) (GDPR) is a law adopted by the [_European Union_](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG) in 2016 that regulates data privacy and security.
	Applies to private and public sector which actively collects data. Also gives rights to users over that info. Establishes baseline for processing personal data, and independent supervisory authority to audit and enforce compliance to their regulations.
	
	Applies to all entities collecting people from European Union REGARLESS of location.

- [**Key disclosure laws**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law) are laws that compel the disclosure of cryptographic keys or passwords under specific conditions such as Part III of the United Kingdom's [_Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000_](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000/Part_III) (RIPA) that can force suspects to disclose decryption keys. 
- **CCPA**: The [_California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018_](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) (CCPA) is a Californian law granting residents of the state certain privacy rights concerning personal information held by for-profit businesses.
	Includes right to opt-out and right to know what info businesses collect.

# Standards and Frameworks

- **PCI DSS**: The [_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard_](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Supporting%20Document/PCI_DSS-QRG-v3_2_1.pdf) (PCI DSS) is an information security standard, first published in 2004, for organizations handling customer payment data for several major credit card companies.
	Outlines best practices and requirements regarding network and system security, vulnerability management and more.

- **CIS Top 18**: The _Center for Internet Security_ (CIS) Critical Security Controls, also known as [_CIS Controls_](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list), is a set of 18 (previously 20) recommended controls intended to increase an organization's security posture.
	Controls are divided into safeguards which are grouped into 3 implementation groups (IG1/2/3) to prioritize accordingly
	
	1 is the minimum standard and increasing number means more complexity for bigger companies.

- **NIST Cyber Security Framework**: The _National Institute for Standards and Technology_ (NIST) [_Cybersecurity Framework_](https://www.nist.gov/industry-impacts/cybersecurity-framework) is a collection of standards and practices designed to help organizations understand and reduce cybersecurity risk.
	The NIST framework consists of three [_components_](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/components-framework): Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles. 
	
	<u>Core</u> is a set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes divided in to 6 high-level functions: Govern, Identify (ID), Protect (PR), Detect (DE), Respond (RS), and Recover (RC)
	
	![[Pasted image 20250622152756.png]] 
	
	*Functions* encompasses certain number of categories like Risk Assessment (ID.RA), and Improvement (ID.IM).
	
	*Each category* is then split further into sub-categories that describe more specific security improvement outcomes like ID.RA.1: Vulnerabilities in assets are identified, validated, and recorded.
	
	<u>Implementation Tiers</u> specify the degree to which an org's Cybersecurity policies satisfy the outcomes outlined in the sub categories of Core. There are four such Tiers: partial (the least degree), risk-informed, repeatable, and adaptive.
	
	<u>Framework Profiles</u> refer to the relationship between Current Profile (present implementation of policies) and Target Profile, tracking your progress toward outcomes.

- **ATT&CK** and **D3FEND**: The [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/) organization has tabulated and organized a framework for cataloging how groups of attackers work together to infiltrate systems and achieve their goals.
	The [_MITRE ATT&CK_](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework, is constantly updated to reflect the latest TTPs used by malicious groups across the globe.
	
	The more recently released [_D3FEND_](https://d3fend.mitre.org/)that portrays a set of best practices, actions, and methodologies employed by defenders to prevent, detect, mitigate, and react to attacks.

- **ISA/IEC 62443**: This standard defines the security requirements to secure [_Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS)_](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/capabilities/industrial-automation-control.html).
	Sets best practices for security controls and provide a way to assess maturity level of org's OPSec

- **Cyber Kill Chain**: The [_Cyber Kill Chain_](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) is a methodology developed by Lockheed Martin to help defenders identify and defend against cyber-attacks. Outlines 7 stages of attack lifecycle.
	1. Reconnaissance: Identifies and enumerates weaknesses of targets
	2. Weaponization: Decide how to attack
	3. Delivery: Launches attack
	4. Exploitation: Payload executed on target system
	5. Installation: Malware installed on target
	6. Command and Control: Execute further commands
	7. Actions on Objectives: Actions to obtain outcomes e.g. data theft

- **FedRAMP**: The [_Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program_](https://www.fedramp.gov/program-basics/) (FedRAMP) is a [United States program](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/fedramp) that provides a standardized security framework for cloud services used by the federal government.
	Based on [NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r4/upd3/final) and aims to make adoption of cloud services secure.
