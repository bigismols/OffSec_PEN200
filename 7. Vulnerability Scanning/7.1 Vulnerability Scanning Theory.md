# 4 important components

1. Host Discovery
	[_Host Discovery_](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/292.html) tells us if target is up and responding. 
2. Port Scanning
3. OS, Service and Version Detection
4. Matching results to a vulnerability database
	Examples of vulnerability databases are the [_National Vulnerability Database_](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [_Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures_](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) (CVE) program.

Vulnerabilities are identified by the [CVE system](https://cve.mitre.org/). They use a framework called [_Common Vulnerability Scoring System_](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) (CVSS) to score CVEs. The two major versions are [CVSS v2](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) and [CVSS v3](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide). 

A [_false positive_](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsepositive.shtml) occurs when a vulnerability is detected but the target is not vulnerable. This can be due to wrong service or version detection or when security fixes are applied to older software.

A [_false negative_](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsenegative.shtml) occurs when vulnerability is not detected by scanner. 

We need to balance between manual and automated scans. We need to think about the balance of time consumed and accuracy of scanners. 

# Types of Scans

1. Internal
2. External
3. Authenticated
4. Unauthenticated
