# 4 important components

1. Host Discovery
	[_Host Discovery_](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/292.html) tells us if target is up and responding. 
2. Port Scanning
3. OS, Service and Version Detection
4. Matching results to a vulnerability database
	Examples of vulnerability databases are the [_National Vulnerability Database_](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [_Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures_](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) (CVE) program.

Vulnerabilities are identified by the [CVE system](https://cve.mitre.org/). They use a framework called [_Common Vulnerability Scoring System_](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) (CVSS) to score CVEs. The two major versions are [CVSS v2](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) and [CVSS v3](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide). 

A [_false positive_](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsepositive.shtml) occurs when a vulnerability is detected but the target is not vulnerable. This can be due to wrong service or version detection or when security fixes are applied to older software.

A [_false negative_](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsenegative.shtml) occurs when vulnerability is not detected by scanner. 

We need to balance between manual and automated scans. We need to think about the balance of time consumed and accuracy of scanners. 

# Types of Scans

1. Internal
	We have direct access to part of / complete internals network. Via VPN or scan on-site.
2. External
	Targets are often web apps,  systems in the [_demilitarized zone_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_\(computing\))(DMZ), and public-facing services. Often scope of machines are given, but sometimes they want us to enumerate the security of their system from outside.
3. Authenticated
	Given credentials. Goal is to check for vulnerable packages and other security flaws. 
4. Unauthenticated
	No proving credentials given. Meant to find vulnerabilities in remotely accessible services on a target. BUT, no info on local security flaws e.g. missing patches. outdated software.

# Considerations in a Vulnerability Scans

- Scanning Duration
	Some scan long because many hops and networks in between. Once given scope, need to plan properly what you want to scan.
- Target Visibility
	From external, consider firewalls and other access restriction mechanisms in place. From internal, consider firewalls, [_intrusion prevention systems_](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/intrusion-prevention-system.html) (IPS), and intermediate network devices (such as routers), can filter or alter our traffic. Our scan can also be [_rate limiting_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting), which is used to limit the amount of traffic on a network -> slow us down.
- Network and System Impact of Scan
	Can produce lots of network noise (traffic and logs). May render a network unusable (DoS) or destabilize the system.
