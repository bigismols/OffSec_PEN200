# NSE Vulnerability Scripts

We can also use the [NSE](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html) to perform automated vulnerability scans. Scripts are categorized in different network tasks like brute-force, vulnerability detection etc. An NSE script can also be in multiple categories:
- `safe:` no potential impact to stability
- `intrusive`: may crash target service
*We can browse [_NSE Documentation_](https://nmap.org/nsedoc) or locally in the NSE scripts directory (`ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*`)*. Can also navigate to this directory and do `cat scripts.db | grep "\"vuln\""`. Can do this with whatever category you want.

`sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "vuln" 192.168.50.124`
	Uses ALL scripts in the vuln category. Most output is from "vulners" script which includes CVE and CVSS scores. Also lists POC for found vulnerabilities marked by \*EXPLOITS\*

We can google for \[CVE_ID] NSE so we can download the script tied to the specific vulnerability. Be careful when you download vulnerabilities. 

`sudo cp /home/kali/Downloads/http-vuln-cve-2021-41773.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-vuln-cve2021-41773.nse`
	 Then `sudo nmap --script-updatedb` then we can do the above command to execute the script, with the filename as the script name.

*NOTE:* Nessus is a good REAL-LIFE tool but cannot be used in OSCP.
