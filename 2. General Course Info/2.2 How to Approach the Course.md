# Model of Increasing Uncertainty

InfoSec and Pen Testing is about *reasoning under uncertainty,* making predictions under incomplete data. We make assumptions and estimate probabilities and make plans off of those.

We learn pen testing techniques like info gathering and lateral movement, but also how to think and feel in certain scenarios.

# Uncertainty in Labs

1. Demo exercises
	 You follow along and copy. Low uncertainty.
2. Applied Module Exercises
	Slightly increased uncertainty, apply novel skills to limited scenarios.
3. Capstone Module Labs
	Encompasses multiple learning units -> increased uncertainty but still under constrained parameters. We know what attacks and what machines to attack from start to finish.
4. Scenarios (challenge labs 0-3)
	Has background story to put machines in context. Tests on multiple modules. High uncertainty -> we don't know which machines are vulnerable to what. Also don't know which machine is vulnerable. Will increase with increasing lab number.
5. Challenge Labs 4-6
	More exam-like. 3 machines connected via AD and each machine is standalone. AD set worth 40 points and each machine worth 20 points. Expected to modify technique to use them to certain environments.
6. Challenge Labs 7-10
	Beyond scope of OSCP exam, and much harder than 0-6. May require skills beyond what is taught in PEN200.
