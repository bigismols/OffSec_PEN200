## Purpose of Course

- Better understand attacks till you can replicate them.
- From there, understand how to defend against these attacks

## Learning Modalities

1. Learning Modules
	Covers concepts about pen testing, as well as, techniques. Have simple QnA. May also have exercises consisting of question, a machine and a flag (to be submitted in the OffSec Learning Portal or OLP). *Flags generated on machine boot and expire on machine shutdown*.
	
	If require ssh to connect to machine, recommended extra options are:
	```
	ssh -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" learner@192.168.50.52 
	```
	This is NOT best practice for security (may lead to MITM attacks). First option is to prevent server host key from being recorded -> every time you connect to the machine == first time you connect. Second option tells SSH not to verify authenticity of server host key.

2. Challenge Labs
	Apply learned techniques. Uses VPN which creates an encrypted tunnel to allow data to travel in the open network and connect to isolated network securely.
	
	Client-to-Client VPN traffic is **STRICTLY** forbidden. Generate vpn file from OLP then do ```sudo openvpn openvpn_filename``` to connect. This terminal needs to remain open.

## Student Support

They have a discord accessible through the OLP resources section. Also have the pen-200-hints bot in discord to help with specific exercise questions.
