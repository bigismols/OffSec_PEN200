**Focus**: Web Application Attacks
- PEN200 tests on OWASP Top 10 but don't need to be good at ALL.
- Port 3306 usually can try SQL injection
- Apache 2.4.49 vulnerable to path traversal
- CyberChef and https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet for fast URL encoded reverse shell one liners!

**Burp Features**:
1. Http History
2. Intercept
3. Repeater (to send custom request)

	*Autorecon*: Does certain nmap scans automatically (noisy ,thorough)

2. Union
3. Blind (Most difficult)
