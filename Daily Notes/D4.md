- Needed to add domain name to /etc/hosts then go to the org site
- Then wpscan and search for vuln in plugins and themes to find admin log in

**Windows Privilege Escalation**: 
- dir /s flag.txt (to search all subdirs) 
	- as opposed to just searching in explorer which DOESN'T include 
- whoami /groups
- systeminfo
- net user
- net localgroup \[groupName]
- netstat -ano
- Get-LocalUser
- Get-LocalGroup
- Get-LocalGroupMember "nameOfGroup"
- Get-Process
- Get-Process "procName" | Select-Object -Path (to get file name from procName)
- Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.kdbx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
- Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
	- to find 32/64 bit, can remove the select here to display all properties
- Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
	- for 64 bit
- Get-history(GetPSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath / or just Get-History

**Windows Access Control:**
- Entities have SID (Sec ID) and RID (relative?) and GID
- These are used to generate access token attached to processes/threads --> determines permission for those.
