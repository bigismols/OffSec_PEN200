**Exam**: 443 (https), Cryptography not in scope

Report writing during exam can follow template, show step by step (with screenshots)
Firewall and phishing also out of scope

**Will focus on Nmap** (Chapter 6: Information Gathering)

# Go thru template for [[Template - Name of the box.pdf|info gathering]]

- Use systematic steps
- Find the target, enumerate from outside exploit to inside, enumerate and exploit inside to get root
- Don't go into rabbit holes (stick to the plan)
- Keep notes for each exploit then you can just search your notes if you encounter the same service. (can copy paste the template and reuse that to take notes!)
- No stego, no morse? LOL. They want to test our **methodology**
