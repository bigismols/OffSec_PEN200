[_Directory Traversal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack) attacks, also known as _path traversal_ attacks, used to access sensitive files on web server. Different systems have different web roots (and this is where we navigate / from). For linux , the var/www/html/ is the web root. 

If we see something like `https://example.com/cms/login.php?language=en.html` then we should check if we can access `/cms/en.html`. We also see that the system uses php files!

# Exploiting Dir Traversal

`http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
	Use this relative path in the URL to try to navigate to the sensitive files. Does not need to have this page variable.

If we can find usernames and passwords here then we can do `http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa`
	This is where ssh keys and all that can be found.

*Instead of typing in URL bar*, we can also use Curl or Burp.

`curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa`
	This achieves the same as above. And may print out the private rsa key!

 Following this we can do `ssh -i dt_key -p 2222 offsec@mountaindesserts.com`
	 -i to specify private key.

For **Windows** machines, direct equivalence to these files do NOT exist. `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` is readable to all local hosts so we can test traversal at this file.
	Instead, we need to find specific software or services running, then search for where these services store their sensitive files. `../` may work in Windows but there are some that are only vulnerable to `..\`

# Encoding Special Characters

Some Internet Servers are only vulnerable in certain pages like [Apache 2.4.49](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41773). This vulnerability can be exploited by using a relative path after specifying the **cgi-bin** directory in the URL. However the `../` may be filtered away by either the web server, [web application firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall), or the web application itself. 

We can use [_URL Encoding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), also called _Percent Encoding_, to potentially bypass these filters, where . is replaced by %2e. We can use tools like https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ to do this encoding. Now, our command looks like `curl http://192.168.50.16/cgi-bin/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd`. This works if they only check for plain text and use some kind of encoding in their URL.
