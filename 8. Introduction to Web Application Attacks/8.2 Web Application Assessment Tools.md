# Nmap Scripts

Refer to [[6.4 Active Info Gathering]] for using specific scripts in Nmap

# Tech Stack Identification with Wrapperlyzer

[_Wappalyzer_](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) allows us to enter a domain name and it will tell us about the tech stack of the web app. Includes OS and libraries.


# Dir Brute-forcing with Gobuster (NOISY)

[_Gobuster_](https://www.kali.org/tools/gobuster/) is a enumeration tool (written in Go language). Includes fuzzing and [[6.4 Active Info Gathering|DNS]]. 

`gobuster dir -u 192.168.50.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5`
	-u for target IP, -w to specify wordlists and -t to reduce amount of threads used (default 10)

*Can also use `feroxbuster -u IP` which is recursive (unlike gobuster)*

# Security Testing with Burp Suite

[_Burp Suite_](https://portswigger.net/burp) is a GUI-based integrated platform for web application security testing which can also be started from `burpsuite`. Mainly used to intercept HTTP traffic, but can also brute-force, and modify packets captured.

## Proxy Tab

- Intercept: When turned on, able to intercept request that go thru the Burp proxy (can be configured in settings e.g. what IP and what port proxy).
	Needs to configure our browser to use this proxy (at whatever port and ip we configured)
- HTTP History: That we can see every packet that goes thru the proxy.
	We can analyze the request and response here.
- Repeater: From HTTP History, we can `Send to Repeater` after write clicking the request and we are able to modify the request and send it again!
- Intruder: The Burp brute-force tool. `Send to Intruder` to explore capabilities.
	**Positions** sub-tab where we can add or remove "variables" to be brute-forced.  **Payloads** sub-tab to specify word list (and other payloads to send along with request). Simple list payload type for word list. S**tart Attack** top right button.
