[_Cross-Site Scripting_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) is a vulnerability that exploits a user's trust in a website by dynamically injecting content into the page rendered by the user's browser. Able to be done if no [_data sanitization_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation). High risk and prevalent as it allows injection of client-side scripts. 

# Stored vs XSS Theory

[_Stored_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Persistent_\(or_stored\)) XSS aka Persistent XSS means exploit payload (into smth like comments section) is stored and cached in server and displayed to all users accessing the web page.

[_Reflected_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Non-persistent_\(reflected\)) _attacks_ usually include the payload in a crafted request or link. Web app will take the value and place into page content. Only attacks the person submitting the request or visiting the link.

BOTH can be either client-side (browser) or server-side or DOM based. [_DOM-based XSS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Server-side_versus_DOM-based_vulnerabilities) takes place solely within the page's [_Document Object Model_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (DOM). This means that the BROWSER executes the payload, not the web app itself.

# Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

Find input fields that accept unsanitized inputs. Input special characters like < > ' " { } ; and see if any of them are unfiltered. HTML uses < > and the rest are used by JS. Application doesn't encode these characters -> May be vulnerable to XSS. Depending on what kind of encoding, can input the encoded characters to mimic the special characters! -> This input may be executed by the browser/webapp/server. Input can end up being something like `<script>[JSCODE]</script>`.

*XSS can be used to get admin access and then privilege escalate / perform CSRF*
