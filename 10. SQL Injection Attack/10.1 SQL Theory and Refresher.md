Currently ranked third among [_OWASP's Top 10_](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) Application Security Risks. It is listed as: [_A03:2021-Injection_](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

What a basic SQL select statement looks like: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name='leon'`

An example of how backend PHP code interact with its SQL Database:
```
<?php
$uname = $_POST['uname'];
$passwd = $_POST['password'];

$sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= '$uname' AND password='$passwd'";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $sql_query);
?>
```
*The mysqli_query function is what facilitates this connection.*

# DB Types and Characteristics

We will focus on MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) as two SQL variants. [_MySQL_](https://www.mysql.com/) is one of the most deployed database variants, along with [_MariaDB_](https://mariadb.org/), an open-source fork of MySQL. 

## MySQL

`mysql -u root -p'root' -h 192.168.50.16 -P 3306`
	Connects to an MySQL service at **port 3306**.

`select version();`
	To see version of databse.

`select system_user();`
	To verify the current user@IP

`select database()`
	To see current database were "in". 

`show databases;`
	 To see the current existing databases

`SELECT user, authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'offsec';`
	Where mysql is the name of a database and user is a column of data. Passwords stored are often hashed! We can crack the hash tho. 

`USE database_name`
	To access the database

`SHOW TABLES`
	To see the tables' name in the database

`DESCRIBE table_name`
	To see the tables and its columns. Then we can do select statements!

## MSSQL

Database management system that integrates natively into a Windows ecosystem. Windows has a built-in command-line tool named [_SQLCMD_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility), that allows SQL queries to be run through the Windows command prompt.

Kali Linux includes [_Impacket_](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket), a Python framework that enables network protocol interactions. Among many other protocols, it supports [_Tabular Data Stream_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/893fcc7e-8a39-4b3c-815a-773b7b982c50/) (TDS), the protocol adopted by MSSQL that is implemented in the _impacket-mssqlclient_ tool.

`impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth`
	Is how we connect to a MSSQL service running on that instance with `user:password`

`SELECT @@version;`
	To see version of MSSQL of database.

`SELECT name FROM sys.databases;`
	To see all available databases.

`SELECT * FROM offsec.information_schema.tables;`
	To review the whole database's tables (here we are looking at the offsec database)

`select * from offsec.dbo.users;`
	To select the table but we need to specify the table schema in between. Here, it is dbo.
